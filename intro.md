```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Navigating Jupyter Book Configuration and Syntax - I found it challenging to get accustomed to the specific configuration and syntax required by Jupyter Book. Understanding how to correctly format documents, especially with MyST Markdown for advanced features like citations was complex.
- Troubleshooting and Debugging - I struggled with errors such as formatting issues, broken links, or problems with cell metadata. Diagnosing and fixing these issues was challenging. Ensuring that the content renders correctly in the built book, as opposed to how it appears in a Jupyter Notebook, also required testing and adjustments, which I found to be a sometimes confusing process.
