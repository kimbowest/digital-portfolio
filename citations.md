# Acknowledgments

The image of the data scientist was generated {cite}`logoface` using AI-powered face generator that produces photos of people who do not exist at a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. {cite}`logoface`

The contents of CV and Cover letter {cite}`chatgpt` are modified from the output generated by ChatGPT. {cite}`chatgpt`

## References

```{bibliography}


In this revised version:

- The `{cite}` syntax is used to add references to the sentences about the AI-generated image and the contents of the CV and Cover letter.
- The reference keys (`chatgpt` and `logoface`) correspond to the BibTeX entries in your `references.bib` file.
- The `## References` section with ````{bibliography}``` will automatically generate a bibliography section based on the citations used in the document and the entries in your `references.bib` file.

After making these changes, save the `citations.md` file. Then, rebuild your Jupyter Book to see the updated acknowledgments and references section with proper citations.
